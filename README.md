To use this frontend:

Start your Flask server (python your_backend_file.py)
Open the HTML file in a web browser or serve it from your Flask server at http://localhost:5000

The frontend automatically connects to your backend API at http://localhost:5000/api and provides a complete user interface for email validation with real-time updates and professional result presentation.
